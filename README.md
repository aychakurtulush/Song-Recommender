# Song-Recommender
The Song Recommender project is an innovative application that uses web scraping from Billboard 100 songs and Spotify playlists, and machine learning techniques to suggest personalized music recommendations to its users. This project utilizes unsupervised learning techniques, particularly clustering, to analyze the musical features of songs and group them into distinct clusters based on their similarities.

With the help of web scraping, the project collects data from top-charting Billboard 100 songs and popular Spotify playlists. The collected data includes song titles, artists, genres, and their respective musical features such as tempo, key, and rhythm. Then, the unsupervised learning technique, clustering, is used to group songs with similar features into distinct clusters. This process helps to identify hidden patterns in the data and makes it easier to recommend songs to users based on their musical preferences.

The Song Recommender project provides a user-friendly interface where users can create their profiles and input their music preferences. The application then uses the clustering model to suggest songs that fit their musical tastes. As users interact with the platform, the machine learning model continues to learn and refine its recommendations, making it more accurate and personalized.

In addition to web scraping, the Song Recommender project also utilizes the Spotipy API to access data from the Spotify platform. The Spotipy API allows the project to access information about users' listening habits, such as their most frequently played songs and artists, as well as their saved playlists.

With the help of the Spotipy API, the project can gather even more data to feed into the clustering model, leading to more accurate and personalized music recommendations. By combining data from multiple sources, the Song Recommender project provides a comprehensive view of a user's musical preferences and habits, making it easier to suggest songs that they are likely to enjoy.

### Overall, the Song Recommender project is a powerful tool that utilizes web scraping, machine learning, and unsupervised learning techniques to provide users with personalized and accurate music recommendations. Whether you're looking for the latest chart-toppers or hidden gems from a specific genre, this application has you covered.
